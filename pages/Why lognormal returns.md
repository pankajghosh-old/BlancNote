#### An exploration into why do we model stock returns by lognormal distribution?

*This post is a work-in-progress*

####What is normal distribution?
Also known as "Gaussian" distribution, Normal distribution refers to a family of symmetric continuous distributions characterized by a bell shaped curve around mean \\( \mu \\). Two parameters: mean \\(\mu\\) and variance \\(\sigma^2\\) are enough to define the shape of distribution. 
<!---
Any normal random variable, X ~ N(\\(\mu,\sigma^2)\\), would have a probability distribution function is $$ \frac {1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
